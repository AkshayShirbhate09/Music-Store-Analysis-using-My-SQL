  SUM, COUNT, AVG, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT, CTE, RECURSIVE CTE, ROW_NUMBER
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

📊 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀: Through meticulous analysis, I uncovered trends such as the most popular genres in various countries, top-spending customers per country, and much more.
